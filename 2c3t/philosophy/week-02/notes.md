# Metaphysics studies 

-  the fundamental nature of reality 
-  the first principles of being 
-  identity and change, space and time 
-  causality, necessity, and possibility 
# It includes questions about the relationship 

-  between mind and matter 
-  between substance and attribute

-  the nature of consciousness

# Questions asked in Metaphysics: 

-  What is reality? 
-  What is out there? 
-  Do abstract concepts (like numbers) really exist? 
-  Does Free Will exist? 
-  Is there such a process as cause and effect?

# Ontology and Metaphysics 

__Metaphysics__ is considered one of the four main branches of philosophy, along with __epistemology, logic, and ethics__.

__Metaphysics__ covers a broad range of topics, including questions of __being, existence, becoming, essence, the first principles, freedom, the relationship between mind and matter, and others__.

The __question of being__ is a central topic of metaphysics; __the study of "being"__  is called __ontology__.

__Ontology__ is a central part of metaphysics.

The word __"metaphysics"__ derives from the Greek words μετά (metá, __"after"__) and φυσικά (physiká, __"physics"__). 

It was first used as the title for several of Aristotle's works, because they were usually anthologized after the works on physics in complete editions. 

However, __Aristotle himself did not call the subject of these books metaphysics__: he referred to it as __"first philosophy"__ (Greek: πρώτη φιλοσοφία; Latin: __philosophia prima__).

# Thales: single material substance as originating principle of nature 

__Thales of Miletus(с. 624 с. 548/545 BC)__ was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, and pre-Socratic philosopher, one of the __Seven Sages of Greece__. 

Thales __broken from the use of mythology to explain the world and the universe__, offered naturalistic theories and hypotheses. 

Nature as deriving from a __unity of everything__ based on the existence of a __single ultimate substance__. 

Thales' hypothesis:__originating principle of nature__ was a __single material substance__ - water. 

# Aristotle wrote in Metaphysics: 

"That from which is everything that exists and from which it first becomes and into which it is rendered at last,__its substance remaining under it, but transforming in qualities__, that they say is the element and principle of things that are.... For it is necessary that there be some __nature__ (φύσις), either one or more than one, from which become the other things of the object being saved... Thales the founder of this type of philosophy says that it is water."

# Anaximander: Apeiron - indefinite, infinite, unlimited ground of the universe 

He introduced the abstract __apeiron__ (ἄπειρον "infinite" or "limitless") as an origin of the universe. 

__Origin must be something unlimited in its source, that could create without experiencing decay.__

He employed, in a philosophical context, the term __arche__ (ἀρχή), which until then had meant __beginning or origin__. 

This __archë__ is called "__eternal__ and __ageless__.

According to Anaximander, the __Universe originates in the separation of opposites in the primordial matter.__

Anaximander appears to have asked: 

__"How the primary substance could be one of the particular things?"__

Anaximander proposed an __alternative view__ that contrasted with that of Heraclitus and Thales. 

The best way to understand the world is __not__ to look for the basic element

# Anaximenes: Air - physical basis of everything 

The last of the three philosophers of the Milesian School, considered the first philosophers of the Western world. 

Each were __material monists__ who sought to discover the arche; the __One, underlying physical yet divine basis of everything.__ 

Anaximenes: all was made of air, or literally __aer__ which may also include __mist or vapor__.

# Pneuma ("breath of life") - overarching principle 

He was the __first to use__ the word __pneuma__ as a synonym for __air__. 

One of the __only surviving quotes__ by Anaximenes reads: 
"Just as our soul...being air holds us together, so pneuma and air encompass (and guard) the whole world."

# Nature of Reality from Heraclitus

The central idea of Heraclitus' philosophy is __the unity of opposites__. 

The concept of __impermanence__ in his doctrine of __panta rhei__ (everything flows). 

The world is constantly in flux, __changing__ and staying the same. 

__Change__ is the byproduct of a __cosmic order - Logos__

Basic substance in the universe is __fire__. 

__"No one steps into the same river twice"__.

# Materialist monism vs metaphysical monism 

Eleaticism was distinguished by its __radical monism__ 
its doctrine of __the One__: 
1. all that exists is a __static plenum__ of Being as such 
2. all differentiation, motion, and change must be __illusory__ 
3. existence, thought, and expression __coalesce into one__ 

The Eleatics __ignoring perceptual appearances__, pursued a __rationalistic__ approach 

found reality in the __all-encompassing, static unity and fullness of Being__. 

Parmenides was the __father of pure ontology__.

# Parmenides: The language is not merely a symbol but corresponds to reality in its very structure. 

__"For it is the same thing that can be thought and that can be."__

__Rejection of every change__ (birth, movement, growth, death) 

The __real Being has no difference, no lack, no variety__ whatsoever in itself.

Parmenides: __"all Being is neighbour of all Being."__ 

Melissus: the __negation__ of every form of __kenon ("void")__, of some __Non-Being__.

# The paradoxes of Zeno: discrediting the beliefs in plurality and motion 

Zeno did not really propose a philosophy different from that of Parmenides but only tried to support it 

## There are several __arguments against plurality__ by which Zeno upheld his master's theory of the unique real Being 

__The first__: if things are __really many__, everything must be __infinitely small and infinitely great__

__The second__: If things are __more than one__, they must be numerically both __finite and infinite __

__The third__: If all-that-is is in space, then space itself must be in space, and so on ad infinitum. 

And __the fourth__: If a bushel of corn emptied upon the 
floor makes a noise, each grain must likewise make a noise, but in fact this does not happen.

## Zeno's four arguments against the reality of motion 

The __first argument__ is known as __"The Dichotomy": A body in motion can reach a given point only after having traversed half of the distance.__

But before traversing half, it must traverse __half of this half__, and so on ad infinitum. Consequently, the goal can __never__ be reached.

The __second argument__ is known as __"Achilles & the tortoise,"__ or the __Achilles paradox__. 

If in a race the tortoise has a start on Achilles, Achilles can never reach the tortoise; for while Achilles traverses the distance from his starting point to that of the tortoise, the tortoise will have gone a certain distance, and while Achilles traverses this distance, the tortoise will have gone still farther, __ad infinitum__. 

Consequently, __Achilles may run indefinitely without overtaking the tortoise.__ 

This argument is __fundamentally identical to the previous one__, with the only difference being that here __two bodies__ instead of one are __moving__.

The __third argument, "The Arrow" is the strongest__ of them all. It says the following: 
__So long as anything is in a space equal to itself, it is at rest.__
 
Now, an arrow is in a space equal to itself at every moment of its flight; therefore, even the flying arrow is at rest all of the time.

And the __final argument, "The moving rows", or "Stadium",__ says:  __Two bodies moving at equal speed traverse equal spaces in an equal time.__ But when two bodies move at equal speed in opposite directions, one passes the other in __half of the time__ that a moving body needs to pass a body that is __at rest.__

# The Eleatics 

The true __explanation of things__ lies in the conception of a __universal unity of being.__

The __senses cannot cognize this unity__ 

__Thought__ is single way to the __fundamental truth__: 
__"All is One"__. 
There can be __no creation__.
